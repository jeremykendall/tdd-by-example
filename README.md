Exercises from ["Test-Driven Development By Example"][1] by Kent Beck

(This is my first foray into python, so if you have some suggestions, it
wouldn't hurt my feelings if you sent me a pull-request.)

Checklist
---------

* ~~Invoke test method~~
* ~~Invoke setUp first~~
* ~~Invoke tearDown afterward~~
* Invoke tearDown even if the test method fails
* ~~Run multiple tests~~
* ~~Report collected results~~
* ~~Log string in WasRun~~
* ~~Report failed tests~~
* Catch and report setUp errors
* Create TestSuite from a TestCase class

Although the checklist isn't complete, Chapter 23 is the last of the "code along" chapters in Part II: The xUnit Example.  Kent says, "I will leave the rest of these items to you and your new-found TDD skills."

Running the Tests
-----------------

From the command line, run `python TestCaseTest.py`
