Exercises from ["Test-Driven Development By Example"][1] by Kent Beck

(This is my first foray into python, so if you have some suggestions, it
wouldn't hurt my feelings if you sent me a pull-request.)

Checklist
---------

* ~~Invoke test method~~
* Invoke setUp first
* Invoke tearDown afterward
* Invoke tearDown even if the test method fails
* Run multiple tests
* Report collected results

Running the Tests
-----------------

From the command line, run `python TestCaseTest.py`
